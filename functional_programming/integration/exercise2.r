### The trade-off between integration rules is that more complex rules are slower to compute, but need fewer pieces. For sin() in the range [0, Ï€], determine the number of pieces needed so that each rule will be equally accurate. Illustrate your results with a graph. How do they change for different functions? sin(1 / x^2) is particularly challenging.
