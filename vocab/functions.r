### Explanations for functions I felt like weren't obvious, or well covered already in the chapter.  Erred on the side of inclusion.

?fn       # brings up the man page for function.  Equivalent to `help(fn)`.
str(obj)  # tells you the structure of the obj.  Great with lists.
objA %in% objB      # is objA contained within objB?  TRUE / FALSE for each element in objA.
match(objA, objB)   # returns a vector with the positions within objB that all the elements of objA are contained, or NA if they're not contained.
a = 2     # Assignment operator, gives a the value 2.  Unlike `<-`, it can only be used in the top level of the scope  Just never use `=`.
a <- 2    # Assignment operator that can be used anywhere.
a <<- 2   # Assignment operator, but assigns to a as a global variable (in the root scope).
df$name   # returns the value of the element named 'name' within df.  See "subsetting".
df[x]     # returns the xth element of df (if x is a number) or the element named the value of x if x is a string.  Can be used as a vector.  See "subsetting".
df[[x]]   # returns the value of the xth element of df.  See "subsetting".
with(data, expr)  # evaluates expr with the environment.  For example with(list(y = 2), y + 1) will return 3. Pretty complex stuff.
assign('y', val)  # Assigns the variable denoted by the string 'y' the value of val.  a <- 2 is the same as assign('a', 2).  Can do more complex stuff that `<-` can't.
                  # One potential use for assign is that you can create dynamic varaibles.  For example, `var <- 'x'; assign(var, 2)` assigns x as 2, not var.
get('y')  # Gets the value of the variable denoted by the string 'y'.  Can do more complex stuff.
all.equal(2, 3)   # Tests for approximate equality, unlike 2 == 3, based on a threshold.  For example, `all.equal(2, 3, threshold = 2)` is TRUE, even though 2 != 3.
identical(x, y)   # Tests if x is equal to y.  Much more preferable to x == y, because x == y returns a vector of length equal to the length of x and y and errors a lot.
is.na(x)  # TRUE or FALSE depending on whether x is NA.
complete.cases(df)  # Checks each row of `df` to see if there are any NAs in that row.
is.finite(x)      # Checks if x is finite (not Inf, -Inf, NA, or NaN).
a %% b    # Modulus
a %/% b   # Floor division
abs(x)    # Absolute value
sign(x)   # For each element in x, return 1 if the element is positive or TRUE, -1 if the element is negative, 0 if the element is zero or FALSE
signif(x, y)   # Rounds x to y digits.
exp(x)    # Computes the exponential function of x
sum(x)    # ADds up all the values of x.
prod(x)   # Multiplies all the values of x.
pmax(x)   # `max(c(1, 2, 3), c(4, 5, 2))` is 5, the largest number of all the elements in both args.  But `pmax(c(1, 2, 3), c(4, 5, 2)) is c(4, 5, 2)` -- it goes by vector.
cummax(x) # The cumulative maximum as a vector, i.e., cummax(c(x, y, z)) is c(max(x), max(c(x, y)), max(c(x, y, z)))
diff(x)   # The difference between each point in the vector, i.e. diff(c(x, y)) is y - x.  Gets more complex with `lag`, which extends the comparison.
          # diff(c(w, x, y, z), lag = 2) is c(y - w, z - x).  `differences` applies the diff function recursively.  diff(c(1, 2, 3), differences = 2) = diff(diff(c(1, 2, 3)).
rle(x)    # Run length encoding. Tells you the number of times each element appears in x.
missing(arg)  # Within a function, tells you if `arg` was supplied by the caller or not.
on.exit(x)    # x is evaluated in the function when the function exits (either finishes or errors).  on.exit(browser()) is useful for debugging.
return(x)     # Exits the function and returns x.  Should only be used for early returns.
invisible(x)  # x is evaluated and returned, but not printed on console.  Useful if you want your function to not print output.
a & b         # logical AND operator on each element of the vectors, pairwise comparison.  Output is the length of a.
a && b        # logical AND operator on each vector.  Output is of length 1.
all(expr)     # TRUE if expr is all TRUE and FALSE otherwise.  all(c(1, 2, 3) >= 1) is TRUE but all(c(1, 2, 3) > 1) is FALSE.
any(expr)     # TRUE if any value in expr is TRUE.  This is the opposite of all.
intersect(a, b)   # The shared values of a and b.  intersect(c(1, 2), c(2, 3)) is 2.
union(a, b)       # A joint object that contains all unique elements in both a and b.  union(c(1, 2), c(2, 3)) is c(1, 2, 3).
setdiff(a, b)     # Returns the elements of a that are not in b.  setdiff(c(1, 2), c(2, 3)) is 1.  setdiff(c(2, 3), c(1, 2)) is 3.
setequal(a, b)    # Returns TRUE if all elements of a are in b and all elements of b are in a.  setequal(c(1, 2), c(2, 1)) is TRUE.
which(expr)   # Returns the indicies where expr is TRUE.  which(c(1, 2, 3) > 1) returns 2, 3 because both position 2 and position 3 are greater than 1.
t(mat)        # Returns the transposed matrix of matrix mat.
diag(mat)     # Returns the diagonal of matrix mat.
sweep(mat, margin, fn)  # Systematically manipulate the rows or columns of mat.  See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3444889/how-to-use-the-r-function-sweep
                        # margin is 1 if you're applying fn to the rows and 2 for columns, or c(1, 2) for both.
data.matrix(df)         # Converts dataframe df to a matrix.
rep(x, y)     # Makes a vector of x, repeated y times.  rep(c(1, 2), 4) is c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2).
rep_len(x, y)           # Repeats x to make a vector of length y.  rep_len(c(1, 2), 4) is c(1, 2, 1, 2).  Equivalent to rep(x, length.out = y).
seq(x)        # Makes a vector starting from 1, to x.  seq(4) is c(1, 2, 3, 4).
seq(x, y)     # Makes a vector starting at x to y.  seq(2, 4) is c(2, 3, 4).  Also use by to change the increment -- seq(2, 10, by = 3) is c(2, 5, 8).
              # one can also use length.out to make a vector from x to y of precisely length.out with even increments.  seq(2, 10, length.out = 3) is c(2, 6, 10).
              # lastly, one can also use along.width to make a sequence of length(along.width).  seq(2, 10, along.with = c(1, 2, 3)) is also c(2, 6, 10).
seq_along(x)  # The same as seq(along.with = x), which is the same as seq(length(x)). Seq_along only takes one argument, so seq_along can only start at 1.
seq_len(x)    # The same as seq(length.out = x).  Also can only start at 1.
rev(x)        # Reverses vector x.  rev(c(x, y, z)) is c(z, y, x).
sample(x)     # Takes the vector x and shuffles all its elements randomly.  Use set.seed to ensure repeatable results.
              # Note that if x is of length one, rather than using x, sample will use seq_along(x).
sample(x, y)  # Does sample(x) and returns just the first y elements.  Good for getting y random elements from x.
              # By default it will not return the same element twice, you can change that by passing replace = TRUE.  This is sampling with replacement.
              # Also of interest, and little known, is you can pass prob and pass a vector of probabilities to weight the results according to that vector.
unlist(l)     # Converts list l into a vector.
split(x, f)   # Splits x (vector or dataframe) into groups defined by levels(f) where f is a factor.
              # See `split(1:10, as.factor(c(1, 2))` and `split(1:10, as.factor(rep(1:2, 5)))` as instructive examples.
expand.grid(a, b, ...)     # Makes all possible combinations of the vector args supplied and makes a dataframe out of them.
                           # See `expand.grid(1:10, 2:11)` and `expand.grid(1:3, 5:8, 22:25)` as instructive examples.
break     # Exits out of a for or while loop without finishing executing the loop.
next      # Exits out of the current iteration of the loop without finishing executing that iteration and advances to the next iteration.
switch(var, val1 = r1, val2 = r2, ...)  # A case statement.  If var has value val1, then return r1.  If var has value val2, then return r2, etc.
ifelse(test, yes, no)                   # Runs test, executes yes if the test is TRUE and executes no otherwise.  Great for quick if this else that expressions.
apply(mat, margin, fn)     # Apply function fn to the rows of matrix mat (if margin is 1) or the columns of mat (if margin is 2).
lapply(obj, fn)       # Iterates over all elements of object obj and returns a list with the result of evaluating function fn on each element.  A lot like Ruby's map function.
                      # For example, lapply(list(a = 2, b = 3), function(x) { x + 1 }) would add one to each value, returning list(a = 3, b = 4).
sapply(obj, fn)       # Like lapply, except instead of returning a list, returns a vector or matrix.
vapply(obj, fn, fv)   # A faster sapply, because you specify fv, which is an example of the desired output.
tapply(obj, f, fn)    # Breaks apart obj by factor f (like we saw with `split`) and then applies function fn to each part.
                      # For more on apply, lapply, sapply, vapply, and tapply, read http://bit.ly/1unY814
replicate(times, expr)     # Distinct from `rep` and `rep_len`.  TODO: Not sure how.
ISOdate(year, month, day)       # Makes a date object.  Can also pass hour, minute, and second.  You can set the timezone with the tz variable.
ISOdatetime(y, m, d, h, m, s)   # Like ISOdate, but passing in an hour, minute, and second is mandatory.
strftime(Sys.time())  # Converts the time into a string.  Can be formatted using http://bit.ly/1BN617P
strptime              # I'm not super clear on the difference between `strftime` and `strptime`, but `strptime` seems to require a formatting string whereas `strftime` does not.
                      # For example, `strptime(Sys.time())` errors.
date()                # Returns today's date.  Does not accept arguments.  (See also `Sys.date()`, which formats things a bit more logically in my opinion, and allows math.)
difftime(day1, day2)      # Tells you the amount of days between day1 and day2.  Can use other units by passing a third parameter with the string of the unit you want.
julian(System.Date())     # Converts the date to julian days, or the number of days since January 1, 4713 BC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day>.
months(System.Date())     # Outputs the month of the date as a string.
quarters(System.Date())   # Outputs the quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) of the date.
weekdays(System.Date())   # Outputs the day of the week (e.g., Monday).
library(lubridate)        # Load's Hadley's lubridate package <https://github.com/hadley/lubridate> which adds functions making it easier to work with times in R.
grep(needle, haystack)    # Searches object haystack for object needle and returns the position in haystack that needle is in.
                          # Example: `grep(1, c(3, 2, 1))` outputs 1.  Note that needle can only be length one, so `grep(c(2, 1), c(3, 2, 1))` won't work.
                          # Also note that grep (and agrep, grepl, and gsub) all take regex patterns as the search string (needle).
agrep(needle, haystack)   # Like grep, except strings can be off by a little bit.
                          # Compare `agrep('hip', 'happy')` (outputs 1) to `grep('hip', 'happy')`, which outputs `integer(0)`, or no matches.
                          # Futher reading: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance
grepl(needle, haystack)   # Don't know why Hadley has you learn `agrep` but not `grepl`. `grepl` is like `grep`, except it returns TRUE or FALSE instead of the index.
                          # Usually `lgrep` is the grep we want when querying interactively, because we're just curious if haystack contains needle.
gsub(needle, replacement, haystack)   # Searches haystack for all instances of needle and replaces them with replacement.
strsplit(what, where)     # Splits object what by every instance of where.
                          # Example: `strsplit("Hello, my name is Paul", " ")` outputs the vector `c("Hello," "my", "name", "is", "Paul")`.
chartr(needle, replacement, haystack)    # `chatr` is a weird function that, letter-by-letter replaces needle with replacement in haystack.
                                         # Example: hartr("Heo", "Hiy", "Hello") replaces "Hello" with "Hilly", because "H" is swapped with "H", "e" with "i", and "o" with "y".
                                         # I challenge you to actually find a use for this.
nchar(x)   # If you want to how many letters are in "hello", you might be tempted to use `length("hello")`.  That's incorrect, because that's about vector length, which is 1.
           # Instead, you want `nchar("hello")`, which is the proper 5.
tolower(x)   # Converts x to entirely lowercase letters.
toupper(x)   # Converts x to entirely upercase letters.
             # There's no R built-in to capitalize just the first letter, but many packages introduce functions that can do it.
             # Alternatively, make your own: `capitalize <- function(x) paste0(toupper(substring(x, 1, 1)), substring(x, 2))
substr(x, start, stop)    # Speaking of that capitalize function, here's what makes it work.  `substr` takes all letters of x from position `start` to position `end`.
substring                 # Substring is like substr, except stop is one million by default.  In nearly every case this gets every letter after the starting position.
                          # If you ever have a word with more than one million letters, I guess it won't work as intended...
                          # Maybe instead they should have done `substring <- function(x, start, stop = nchar(x)) substring(x, start, stop)` because that works in R.
                          # ...But I imagine such an implementation would be much slower.
paste(a, b, ...)          # Pass it as many arguments as you want, and it joins all those arguments as a space separated string.
library(stringr)          # Look at Hadley hustling his own package again.  This one offers various string manipulation functions.  I've never found any of them to be useful...
                          # You can look through the offering in the vignette here: https://github.com/hadley/stringr/blob/master/vignettes/stringr.Rmd
factor(x, levels)         # Factors are like vectors, except they record the space of possible values, called levels.  An example of a factor is male / female.
                          # For example, `factor(c("M", "M", "M"), levels = c("M", "F"))` will remember that there can be "F" values (but not "Q" values), despite "F" and "Q"
                          # not appearing in the original vector.
levels(x)                 # Outputs the factor levels.  For `factor(c("M", "M", "M"), levels = c("M", "F"))`, that's `c("M", "F")`.
nlevels(x)                # Counts the number of levels in x.  For `factor(c("M", "M", "M"), levels = c("M", "F"))`, that's 2.
reorder                   # TODO: To be honest, I don't know how to use this.
relevel(x, new_levels)    # Changes the order of levels in x to become new_levels
                          # Example: `reorder(factor(c("M", "M", "M"), levels = c("M", "F")), "F")` changes levels from `c("M", "F")` to `c("F", "M")`.
                          # TODO: I'm not sure what difference that makes, but some functions operate on the first level.
cut(x, y)                 # Breaks x into y equal parts.
findIntreval(x, b)        # Given breaks b, find out which interval in b contains x.
                          # Example: `findInterval(4, c(3, 6, 9))` returns 1 because 4 is between 3 and 6 (in the first interval).
                          # Note that intervals defined by c(3, 6, 9) are <3 (zeroth interval), 3-5 (first interval), 6-9 (second interval), and >9 (third interval).
interaction(f1, f2)       # Merges together pairwise combinations of factors f1 and f2.
                          # Example: interaction(factor(c("M", "M", "M"), levels = c("M", "F")), factor(c(1, 2, 1), levels = c(1, 2))) is
                          # c(M.1, M.2, M.1) with levels c(M.1, F.1, M.2, F.2).
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)   # Data frames will convert character vectors to factors by default.  This annoys nearly everyone.
                                    # By setting this parameter in your R session (or better yet, your ~/.Rprofile), you avoid this from happening.
                                    # See ?data.frame for details.
array(x)                  # An array is basically a one-dimensional matrix.
dim(x)                    # Tells you the dimensions (rows and columns) of a matrix or data frame.
dimnames(x)               # Produces a length 2 list with all the row names and all the column names.
aperm(mat, perm)          # Permutates matrix mat by perm.  Best seen in examples: `matrix(seq(3))` makes a 1-column 3-row matrix, but
                          # `aperm(matrix(seq(3)), c(2, 1))` transforms it into a 3-column 1-row matrix.
library(abind)            # You may know `rbind` that combines multiple matricies or data frames by rows, and `cbind` which combines by columns.
                          # library(abind) loads the abind package, which introduces a function `abind` that does both `rbind` and `cbind`!
                          # Examples: compare `dim(iris)`, `dim(rbind(iris, iris))`, `dim(cbind(iris, iris))`, and `dim(abind(iris, iris))`
                          # Not a Hadley pacakage!
duplicated(x)             # For each element in x, returns FALSE if that element is not already in x and TRUE if it is.
unique(x)                 # Returns a vector of x with all the duplicates removed.
merge(df1, df2)           # Combines df1 and df2, lining them up by shared column names.
sort(x)                   # Puts the values of x into ascending order.  Can pass decreasing = FALSE to make it to descending order.
order(x)                  # Returns the column indicies such that x[order(x)] is the same as sort(x).
rank(x)                   # TODO: Not sure what this does.  Appears to return some sort of ratio?
quantile(x, probs)        # Splits x into even groups defined by probs.  For example, to get quartiles of x, use `quantile(x, seq(0.25, 1, length.out = 4))`.
table(x)                  # Tells you each value of x and how many instances of that value there are.
ftable(x)                 # TODO: Not sure the difference between this and table.
lm(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, iris)   # Makes a linear regression, predicting Petal.Length by Petal.Width.
fitted(x)       # Extracts the fitted values for a model.  For example, look at `fitted(fitted(lm(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, iris)))`.
predict(x)      # TODO: Not sure what this does.  predict(x) seems to return the same as fitted(x) when x is a formula.
resid(x)        # Extracts the residuals for the fitted values of a model.  For example, look at `resid(lm(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, iris))`.
rstandard(x)    # Regression Deletion Diagnostics?  TODO: Don't know what this means.

hat(model)      # TODO: Also Regression Deletion Diagnostics
influence.measures(model)   # Outputs the relative influence of each data point on the model.
logLik(model)               # Extacts the log liklihood of the model.  TODO: Revisit, figure out what this is.
df                 # F Distribution.  TODO: Revisit, figure out what this is.
deviance(model)    # Returns the deviance of the model.  TODO: Revisit, figure out what this is.
formula(model)     # Extracts the formula from a model.  The formula in lm(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, iris) is Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, iris.
I(obj)          # Indicates that obj object should be treated "as is", which supresses R's attempts to coerce the class of obj to other classes.
anova(model)    # Creates an ANOVA table for a given model.
coef(model)     # Extracts the coefficients for the model and tells you their value in the linear relationship (m in "y = mx + b").
confint(model)  # Computes confidence intervals for all coefficients in a model.  Defaults to 95% confidence intervals, but you can specify with the level argument.
contrasts(fac)  # TODO: Not sure what this does.
